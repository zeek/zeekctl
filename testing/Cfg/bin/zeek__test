# This script can be used in place of Zeek for some (but not all) of the zeekctl
# tests.  The advantage of using this script for certain tests instead of
# the real Zeek:  this script never requires superuser privileges to run,
# tests that use this script can be run in parallel with other tests,
# this script automatically terminates after a while in case a test script
# fails to cleanup, and this script can be controlled by a config file to
# simulate various scenarios (crash, slow to start, etc.).
