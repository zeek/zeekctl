1.2-106 | 2014-04-10 08:32:18 -0700

  * Update test baselines, and minor code cleanup. (Daniel Thayer)
    
1.2-104 | 2014-04-05 01:01:29 -0400

  * Updated PF_Ring plugin now supports PF_Ring+DNA. (Seth Hall)

1.2-99 | 2014-03-30 22:21:20 +0200

  * Update documentation with better install/setup instructions.
    Addresses BIT-1160 (Daniel Thayer)

1.2-97 | 2014-03-16 07:40:31 -0700

  * Minor doc update for a broctl option. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Adjust broctl status output to avoid bad column alignment. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * Do not ping when checking if a host is alive. Removed the ping
    from the host alive check because the ping might be blocked by a
    firewall, and neither Bro nor broctl needs the ability to ping
    hosts. (Daniel Thayer)

  * If the current version of Bro doesn't match the version when
    broctl install was previously run, then a warning message (to run
    broctl install) is displayed when broctl starts. Addresses
    BIT-1152. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Reduce the risk of losing track of state info. Changed the way
    broctl updates PIDs and crash flags by writing the new values to
    disk immediately, one at a time, as soon as each new value is
    available. Also changed the way that the state file is updated
    when each command finishes by doing the update as an atomic
    operation. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Better error handling for a number of broctl commands. (Daniel Thayer)
    
  * Improve error output when broctl install has not been run yet.
    (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix a failing test on FreeBSD 10. (Daniel Thayer)
    
  * Changed the output of the check command to be more specific about
    what it is actually checking. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Improve handling of dead hosts and closed/hanging connections.
    (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fixed a typo in the run-bro script that was causing the memlimit
    option to be ignored. Added added a test to verify that memlimit
    is used. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Simplify code that execs commands locally. (Daniel Thayer)
    
  * Prevent infinite loop in start helper script if it cannot execute
    the run-bro script. (Daniel Thayer)

  * pf_ring plugin: Show error if lb_procs is needed but not given,
    and disable plugin if not used. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Catch an exception that is raised when loading a plugin that does
    not override all required methods, and output an error message.
    (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix start helper script to return nonzero on error. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * Improve start/stop command output for crashed nodes.

  * Added a test for stopping a node that crashes during shutdown.
    (Daniel Thayer)


1.2-73 | 2014-02-28 14:44:51 -0800

  * Added ability of broctl cron to expire entries in stats.log that
    are older than the number of days specified in the new broctl
    option StatsLogExpireInterval. Addresses BIT-123. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Add broctl option BroPort to change the starting Bro port.
    Addresses BIT-1117. (Daniel Thayer)

1.2-66 | 2014-02-06 20:29:20 -0800

  * Make sure logs are archived after broctl kills Bro. Addresses
    BIT-1126. (Daniel Thayer)

1.2-63 | 2014-02-04 09:10:39 -0800

  * Fix a few sporadic test failures. (Daniel Thayer)

1.2-61 | 2014-01-31 11:11:39 -0800

  * Fix error handling for process command. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Update and improve the tests of broctl process. (Daniel Thayer)
    
  * Improve broctl help message for the process command. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * Reorder the broctl process command Bro arguments. Addresses
    BIT-1124. (Daniel Thayer)

1.2-56 | 2014-01-28 15:54:14 -0800

  * A large set of improvements to the test build scripts to address
    error scenarios, fix failures to report problems, and provide
    convenience features.  (Daniel Thayer)

    Includes:

        - New Makefile target "rerun" to more easily re-run failed
          tests.

        - Two new environment variables recognized by test scripts:
          
            * If Bro fails to build, you can define an environment
              variable BROCTL_TEST_BUILDARGS which specifies
              additional options that will be passed to Bro's
              "configure" script.

            * Defining BROCTL_TEST_USEBUILD will use the Bro default
              build directory (instead of a custom build directory for
              the broctl tests).

  * Add lots of new tests. (Daniel Thayer)

1.2-28 | 2014-01-22 10:47:49 -0800

  * Fix bug with timemachineport broctl option. (Daniel Thayer)
    
  * Improved formatting of cluster-layout.bro for readability. (Daniel
    Thayer)

1.2-26 | 2014-01-21 07:12:38 -0800

  * Update the docs. (Daniel Thayer)

1.2-23 | 2014-01-20 12:22:42 -0800

  * Move some output about slow nodes to debug.log. (Daniel Thayer)
    
  * Improve broctl output formatting. (Daniel Thayer)
    
  * Fix redundant emails from broctl cron when dead host found.
    (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix broctl top on OS X Mavericks. (Daniel Thayer)
    
  * Fix plugin init return values. This also fixes the myricom plugin,
    which wasn't explicitly returning a value from its init method and
    therefore was being disabled as a result. (Daniel Thayer)

  * Enable dead hosts caching while in cron mode. (Justin Azoff)
    
  * Use getattr for looking up plugin methods for simplifying the
    plugin code. (Justin Azoff)

  * Remove redundant plugin initialization. (Justin Azoff)
    
1.2-12 | 2014-01-20 11:23:23 -0800

  * Fix bug with IPv6Comm broctl option, which had no effect. (Daniel Thayer)

1.2-10 | 2014-01-13 01:57:53 -0800

  * Add a new option "PFRINGClusterType" that allows a user to specify
    a PF_RING cluster type; it defaults to 4-tuple (which is different
    from the 6-tuple that previous versions used). The PF_RING plugin
    uses this information to set the corrresponding environment
    variable for a PF_RING-aware libpcap. Addresses BIT-1108. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * Minor reorganization of the README to avoid redundancy. (Daniel
    Thayer)

1.2-3 | 2013-12-09 13:24:28 -0800

  * Remove unused Broxygen-style script comments. (Jon Siwek)
    
1.2 | 2013-11-07 07:04:54 -0800

  * Release 1.2.

  * Add another warning message when a host is not alive. (Daniel
    Thayer)

1.2-beta-24 | 2013-10-31 00:19:41 -0700

  * Do not check if the local host is "alive". (Daniel Thayer)

1.2-beta-22 | 2013-10-26 19:19:31 -0700

  * Document which broctl options override Bro script variables.
    (Daniel Thayer)

  * Updates and clarifications to docs. (Daniel Thayer)
    
1.2-beta-17 | 2013-10-18 13:22:16 -0700

  * Fix internal lookup of nodes, which would fail to return the right
    items in some cases when node naming didn't match standard
    terminology. Addresses BIT-1091. (Daniel Thayer)

1.2-beta-13 | 2013-10-10 13:38:58 -0700

  * Updating copyright notice. (Robin Sommer)
    
  * Fix the broctl "top" command output on Linux. (Daniel Thayer)
    
  * Fix a race condition when sendmail option is empty string. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * Fix a deadlock when capturing output from local command. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * Improve portability of shell scripts used by broctl. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * Fix for setting REPO in Makefile. (Robin Sommer)

1.2-beta | 2013-09-23 20:30:31 -0700

  * Update 'make dist' target. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix problem with the "broargs" options that would occur when a
    command-line argument in broargs contained a space. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * Change submodules to fixed URL. (Jon Siwek)
    
1.1-190 | 2013-09-20 14:26:41 -0700

  * Add more links in BroControl documentation. (Daniel Thayer)
    
1.1-188 | 2013-09-18 14:46:10 -0700

  * Add tests for new BroControl features (CPU pinning, PF_RING
    multiple cluster IDs, "env_vars") (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix link to git repo to be consistent with other links. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * Fix broken doc links. (Jon Siwek)

1.1-182 | 2013-08-27 13:32:35 -0700

  * Improve CPU pinning documentation and error message. Addresses
    BIT-1068 (Daniel Thayer)

  * Switching to relative submodule paths. (Robin Sommer)
    
  * Documentation fixes. (Daniel Thayer)
    
  * Minor fixes for broctl tests. (Daniel Thayer)
    
  * Fix bug with usage of cmd_restart_pre method. (Daniel Thayer)
    
  * Remove unused subdirectory "spool/scripts". (Daniel Thayer)
    
  * Remove unused imports, variables, and semicolons. (Daniel Thayer)
    
1.1-171 | 2013-08-16 15:36:14 -0700

  * Changed and document the behavior of the SitePolicyPath broctl
    option to not clobber existing files/directories when copying, in
    order to match the expected behavior (directories earlier in the
    list take precedence over directories later in the list when
    duplicate filenames are encountered). Addresses BIT-714. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * A series of changes to make broctl return useful exit codes. (Vlad
    Grigorescu, Daniel Thayer).

    Generally, broctl now returns 0 if everything went ok with regards
    to what the documentation says should have happened, and 1
    otherwise. We keep the following exceptions for now though:

        - "cron" always returns 0.
        - "status" and "top" return 0 if all bro nodes are
          running, and returns 1 otherwise.
        - commands provides by plugins always return 0.

1.1-158 | 2013-08-02 17:06:57 -0700

  * Add ability to set environment variables in node.cfg and
    broctl.cfg via new "env_vars" options taking a comma-separated
    list (e.g., "env_vars=VAR1=1,VAR2=2"). Variables in node.cfg take
    prioroty over broctl.cfg. Addresses BIT-1010. (Daniel Thayer)

1.1-150 | 2013-07-14 08:00:44 -0700

  * Fix broken link in README. (Bernhard Amann, thanks kraigu)

    - Update baselines for recent changes to crash-diag.
    - Remove "make quick" from the README.
    - Minor cleanup of the build script.
    - Remove unused Makefile variable.
    - Remove the "-j" option to make as it can cause lock-ups on
      some machines.
    - Replace realpath command with more portable Python equivalent.

1.1-140 | 2013-06-07 16:35:08 -0700

  * Adding OS to crash output. (Robin Sommer)

  * Giving the broctl test suite its own build directory. (Robin Sommer)

1.1-137 | 2013-05-31 17:16:14 -0700

  * New regression test suite for BroControl. "make test" runs it. See
    testing/README for more information. (Daniel Thayer)
    
1.1-101 | 2013-05-24 17:55:41 -0700

  * Add support for CPU pinning. To use CPU pinning, a new per-node
    option "pin_cpus" can be specified in node.cfg, and the OS must be
    either Linux or FreeBSD (if such a node.cfg is used on another OS,
    then the "pin_cpus" option is ignored). Addresses #996. (Daniel
    Thayer)

1.1-99 | 2013-05-24 17:34:44 -0700

  * Allow multiple conn-summary.log files to be processed to avoid
    conflicts when stopping Bro shortly after a log rotation. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * Prevent deletion of unarchived logs during "broctl stop" when
    archiving takes a while. (Daniel Thayer)

1.1-94 | 2013-05-17 13:29:04 -0700

  * Don't import readline, it's loaded implicitly already. (Daniel
    Thayer)

1.1-92 | 2013-05-17 07:37:13 -0700

  * Removing uncessary directory check. (Robin Sommer)

1.1-91 | 2013-05-16 20:25:00 -0700

  * Stop trying to create the stats/www directory if it already
    exists. Addresses #1007. (Seth Hall)

  * Another batch of fixes. (Daniel Thayer)

    This includes:

    - Fix usage of PF_RING interface containing semicolons.
    - Fix broctl exec command to check for errors.
    - Fix a race condition during broctl start.
    - Remove some dead code.
    - Fix exit status output in debug log.

  * Add support for the "--scriptdir" configure option. Adresses
    #993. (Daniel Thayer)

1.1-79 | 2013-05-10 19:39:55 -0700

  * A set of bug fixes and robustness improvements. (Daniel Thayer)

    This includes:
    
    - Add more error checking and reporting to cron command.
    - Improve error checking of top helper output.
    - Improve error checking of capstats output.
    - Fix a bug when the time command is not found.
    - Fix the broctl top and cron commands on OS X.
    - Fix a couple of bugs in the broctl ps plugin.
    - Remove unused broctl scripts.
    - Improve the check-pid helper script.

1.1-63 | 2013-04-25 16:14:51 -0400

  * Add support for multiple PF_RING cluster IDs

    Instead of assigning the same PF_RING cluster ID to every worker
    in a Bro cluster, the pf_ring broctl plugin has been modified to
    automatically assign a different PF_RING cluster ID for each se
    of workers on a host that all sniff the same interface.  The firs
    such set of workers on a host are assigned the globally-configured
    PF_RING cluster ID (this is the "pfringclusterid" broctl option in
    broctl.cfg).  Each subsequent set of workers on a host that sniff
    another interface are assigned a different value (incremented by
    one from previous value). Addresses #943. (Daniel Thayer)

1.1-61 | 2013-03-22 12:25:22 -0700

  * Fix problem with the cron command hanging sometimes. Addresses
    #591. (Seth Hall)

1.1-59 | 2013-03-17 13:36:04 -0700

  * Lots of small fixes, cleanup, and documentation improvemets (in
    particular, but not only, to the plugin API). (Daniel Thayer).

    This includes:

        - Check for plugins with same prefix
        - Prevent capstats from being run with invalid args
        - Fix plugin inconsistency for certain broctl commands
        - Document the broctl user option KeepLogs?
        - Add a note in documentation about editing crontab
        - Fix broctl plugin option names to be case-insensitive
        - Remove reserved word "cluster" from node args
        - Fix documentation of broctl commands
        - Add calls to plugin cmd_restart_pre/post methods
        - Fix instructions for adding plugin directories
        - Fix the broctl check command to report results
        - Fix handling of cmd_diag_pre for diag command
        - Changed return value of plugin API "execute" method
        - Add return value to some cmd_<cmd>_pre methods
        - Add a check for state variables in broctl.cfg
        - Changed "hosts" method to return list of hosts
        - Call "done" method from plugin API
        - Call hostStatusChanged with correct arg type
        - Fix the parseNodes method in plugin API
        - Fix the "error" method in broctl plugin API
        - Fixed tab-completion of commands with node args
        - Fix broctl plugin API documentation errors
        - Fix typos in TestPlugin? output messages
        - Add cron "--no-watch" option to broctl "help" output
        - Fix the "execute" method of the Plugin class
        - Fix various bugs and remove some unused code

1.1-26 | 2012-12-20 17:53:52 -0800

  * Add Bro version to crash reports. (Robin Sommer)

  * Add a new broctl option "MailConnectionSummary" that specifies
    whether or not to mail the connection summary reports.  (Daniel
    Thayer)

1.1-23 | 2012-12-06 15:52:20 -0800

  * Update documentation for recent MailFrom change. (Daniel Thayer)

1.1-21 | 2012-12-06 08:34:14 -0800

  * MailFrom broctl.cfg option now adds a redef for Notice::mail_from.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Bump CPack RPM package requirement to python >= 2.6.0. (Jon Siwek)
    
1.1-18 | 2012-10-31 14:24:27 -0700

  * Add new broctl.cfg option "MailAlarmsInterval" to allow user to
    specify alarm mail interval. Default is once per day. (Daniel
    Thayer)

1.1-12 | 2012-10-24 15:53:48 -0700

    * Add a message at the top of broctl-generated crash report emails
      that explains how to submit the crash report to a mailing list
      address. Addresses #876. (Daniel Thayer)

1.1-10 | 2012-10-19 15:10:20 -0700

  * Fix `broctl install` to now also copy subdirs in SitePolicyPath.
    Addresses #902. (Jon Siwek)

1.1-8 | 2012-10-19 14:52:23 -0700

  * Add options CompressCmd and CompressExtension to customize log
    compressions scheme. (Justin Azoff)

1.1-3 | 2012-09-25 06:23:34 -0700

  * Updates to documentation. (Daniel Thayer)
    
1.1 | 2012-08-24 15:09:04 -0700

  * Fix MailAlarmsTo broctl config option. Addresses #814. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * Fix configure script to exit with non-zero status on error. (Jon
    Siwek)

1.1-beta-2 | 2012-08-10 12:29:56 -0700

  * Updates to disable STDERR printing from the reporter framework.
    (Seth Hall)

1.1-beta | 2012-07-20 07:03:21 -0700

  * Fix broctl startup when using custom config file dirs. (Jon Siwek)

  * Change crash report info to include stack traces from all threads.
    (Jon Siwek)

  * Changed the invocation of gdb that produces the crash report. (Jon
    Siwek)

1.0-64 | 2012-07-10 16:07:50 -0700

  * Remove automatic override of config file directory with /usr prefix.

  * Small updates to BroControl docs. (Daniel Thayer)

1.0-58 | 2012-07-02 15:55:06 -0700

  * Improvements to built-in load-balancing support. Instead of adding
    a separate worker entry in node.cfg for each Bro worker process on
    each worker host, it is now possible to just specify the number of
    worker processes on each host. (Daniel Thayer)

    This change adds three new keywords to the node.cfg file (to be
    used with worker entries): lb_procs (specifies number of workers
    on a host), lb_method (specifies what type of load balancing to
    use: pf_ring, myricom, or interfaces), and lb_interfaces (used
    only with "lb_method=interfaces" to specify which interfaces to
    load-balance on).

    Two new broctl plugins (which operate automatically and the user
    doesn't need to be aware of them) are added to set the appropriate
    environment variables when either PF_RING or myricom
    load-balancing is being used.

1.0-43 | 2012-07-02 15:40:01 -0700

  * Improve README. Rewrote the section on site-specific customization
    so that it is more clear about the load order of scripts relevant
    to site-specific customization.  Removed the description of
    several features that don't seem to work: "worker-1.local.bro" is
    not automatically loaded, there is no example policy in
    local-manager.bro, local-manager.bro and local-worker.bro do not
    automatically load local.bro, and proxies do not automatically
    load local-worker.bro. (Daniel Thayer)

1.0-40 | 2012-06-06 11:52:06 -0700

    * Fix the "cron disable" command, which didn't work. This also
      removes the config option CronEnabled. The command is now the
      only way to turn off cron operation. (Daniel Thayer)

1.0-38 | 2012-05-24 17:42:37 -0700

  * Improvements to IPv6 support. (Jon Siwek)

    - Add ability to manage a cluster over non-global IPv6 scope (e.g.
      link-local), by specifying "zone_id" keys per node in node.cfg
      and "ZoneID" option in broctl.cfg.

    - Replace socket.gethostbyname lookups with socket.getaddrinfo to
      support IPv6.

    - ::1 is now recognized as the IPv6 loopback and a "local" address
      where before 127.0.0.1 was expected.

    - Update usages of ping, ssh, rsync, and ifconfig to work with IPv6
      addresses.

    - New "IPv6Comm" option in broctl.cfg can be set to 0 to turn off
      IPv6-based communication capabilities (on by default).

1.0-35 | 2012-05-17 11:57:30 -0700

  * BroControl tweaks to support non-ASCII logs. (Robin)

        - The main change is that we give another argument to
          post-processors that indicates the writer type that produced
          the log. That comes with an incompatible part: the
          make-archive-name script now receives the writer as its
          2nd(!) argument. Customized versions need be adapted.

        - The standard postprocessors now check whether they are
          processing something else than ASCII logs and adapt their
          behaviour accordingly (e.g., by not compressing, and or not
          running trace-summary).

1.0-32 | 2012-05-14 17:20:17 -0700

  * Fix typos in broctl docs. (Daniel Thayer)

1.0-29 | 2012-05-03 11:34:29 -0700

  * Added an option to specify 'etc' directory. Addresses #801.
    (Daniel Thayer)

  * Fix typos. (Daniel Thayer)

1.0-24 | 2012-04-24 14:37:49 -0700

  * Update some broctl option descriptions. (Daniel Thayer)

1.0-22 | 2012-04-19 09:52:44 -0700

  * Options SitePolicyStandalone, SitePolicyManager, and
    SitePolicyWorker were unused. Now they are, and they replace the
    hard-coded defaults if defined. Addresses #797. (Daniel Thayer)

1.0-20 | 2012-04-19 09:08:32 -0700

  * Remove unused broctl options and fixed a couple of typos in the
    option names. (Daniel Thayer)

1.0-17 | 2012-04-16 18:06:28 -0700

  * Fixed lots of documentation typos and broken links. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * Update broctl help information. (Daniel Thayer)
    

1.0-13 | 2012-04-09 15:59:17 -0700

  * Remove "-p" option from broctl "scripts" command help. (Daniel
    Thayer)

  * Updating helper script to work with conn.log in Bro 2.0. (Daniel
    Thayer)

   * New broctl.cfg option for log rotation interval. Addresses #630.
     (Jon Siwek)

   * Removed some of the broct/nodes/* scripts and instead
     consolidated their functionality into the node-specific scripts
     that come with Bro's cluster framework. (Jon Siwek)

   * Within the cluster framework, local-<node>.bro scripts should now
     be loaded after the distributions <node>.bro script so things can
     be overrided. (Jon Siwek)

   * Auto-generated broctl scripts are loaded after all node-specific
     scripts and can override their options. (Jon Siwek)

  * Move configuration of PFRINGClusterID from broctl.cfg.in to

0.41-63 | 2011-08-03 22:10:40 -0700

  * Revamped how the work is split between Bro and BroControl. Much of
    functionality previously found in BroControl policy scripts has
    moved over to Bro. (Seth Hall)

  * Adapted BroControl to Bro 2.0 policy scripts.

  * A new plugin interface allows external Python code to hook into
    BroControl processing. See README for more information. (Robin
    Sommer)

    Two example plugins are shipped: (1) "ps.bro" shows all Bro
    processes currently running on any cluster node, even if not
    managed by BroControl; (2) "TestPlugin" is a demo plugin
    demonstrating all the functionality a plugin can use (but doesn't
    do anything sensible with it).

  * A new offline mode for processing a trace. The new command
    "process <trace>" runs Bro offline on the given trace, using the
    current BroControl configuration. One can optionally give give
    further Bro command line options and scripts. In cluster mode the
    the Bro process loads both manager and worker configurations
    simultaniously.

    Addresses #273. (Robin Sommer)

  * Removed the "analysis" command. (Seth Hall)

  * Installation does no longer differentiate between standalone and
    cluster mode. node.cfg now fully controls this. (Seth Hall)

  * Tons of little fixes, improvements, and polishing (Seth Hall, Jon
    Siwek, and Robin Sommer)

0.41-9 | 2011-06-01 11:35:36 -0700

  * Standardize shell script hashbang on install. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix binary package broctl-config.sh symlink installation
    regression. (Jon Siwek)

  * Changes to allow DEB packaging via CPack, addresses #458. (Jon Siwek)

  * Fixed a problem with the "update" command, which could delete data
    from many global state tables unintentionally. (Seth Hall)

0.41-2 | 2011-05-02 11:29:07 -0700

  * Symlink install scripted at install time for CMake 2.6
    compatibility. (Jon Siwek)

0.41 | 2011-04-07 21:14:53 -0700

  * Tweaks to the documentation generation. (Robin Sommer)

  * CMake tweaks. (Jon Siwek)

  * Bugfix: trace-summary sampled in standalone mode rather than cluster
    mode. (Robin Sommer)

  * Bugfix: Creating links from the log directory to the current log files
    didn't work in standalone mode. (Robin Sommer)

  * A new option CompressLogs (default on), indicating whether
    archived logs are to be gzipped. (Robin Sommer)

  * A lot of configure/cmake/install/package tuning. (Jon Siwek)

  * Adding /sbin and /usr/sbin to path local-interfaces script
    searches for ifconfig. Closes #293. (Robin Sommer)

  * Fixing uncaught exception in lock file handling. (Seth Hall).

  * Making cluster event specifications redefinable. (Seth Hall).

  * Fixing for pretty printing numerical values. (Seth Hall).

  * Fixing "netstats" command distinction between cluster and
    standalone mode. (Justin Azoff)

0.4-10 | 2011-01-15 14:14:05 -0800

  * Changes for CPack binary packaging (Jon Siwek)

  * Fix package configuration macro returning from sub-project too early (Jon Siwek)

  * Add warning when building and installing are done by different users (Jon Siwek)

  * Changes to broctl's "make install" process (Jon Siwek)

    - Simplify install by not compiling python code.
    - The broctl-config.sh symlink needs to be made at configure time
      and install()'ed in order for CPack packaging to correctly bundle it
    - Reverted a change in (90ddc4d) to that caused spool/ and logs/
      directories to not be installed in the case that they existed at
      configure time.

  * Fix for PackageMaker not accepting non-numeric versions (Jon Siwek)

0.4-9 | 2011-01-12 08:51:11 -0800

  * Making df portably deal with long lines in the OS's df output.
    (Robin Sommer)

0.4-8 | 2011-01-04 20:30:41 -0800

  * Changing some installation paths. "broctl install" copied a
    number of files to share/bro/*, which violates the common
    assumption that things there are static. It can also create
    permission problems if the user running "broctl install" is not
    the one installing Bro. So now the pieces copied/generated by
    "broctl install" are moved to spool/*. (Robin Sommer)

  * The CMake install does no longer recreate some of the top-level
    directories when they already exist. That makes it possible to
    now symlink them somewhere else after the first install. (Robin
    Sommer)

  * When broctl doesn't find spool/broctl.dat it no longer aborts
    but just warns. That allows CMake to skip installing an empty
    one. (Robin Sommer)

  * Deleting an unused policy file. (Robin Sommer)

  * Updating update-changes script. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-5 | 2010-12-20 14:10:25 -0800 | 768a9e550c3554de2e0bf9e3af2ae99400203046

  * New helper script for maintaing CHANGES file. (Robin Sommer)

0.4-1 | 2010-12-20 12:03:34 -0800 | a05be1242b4e06dca1bb1a38ed871e7e2d78181b

  * Fix for dealing with large vsize values reported by "top" (Craig
    Leres)

  * Fixed the top helper script to assign the command variable
    appropriately. (Seth Hall)

  * Escape commands given to CMake's execute_process (Jon Siwek)

0.4 | Fri Dec 10 01:35:36 2010 -0800 | df922e8a64a631aadb485b5044fe9ae1046d47ca

- Moving BroControl to its own git repository.

- Converting README to reST format.

- Renamed "Capstats" config option to "CapstatsPath".

- Merge with Subversion repository as of r7098. Incorporated changes:

  o Increasing default timeouts for scan detector significantly.

  o Increasing the manager's max_remote_events_processed to
    something large, as it would slow down the process too much
    otherwise and there's no other work to be interleaved with it
    anyway.

  o Adding debug output to cluster's part of catch-and-release
    (extends the debugging already present in policy/debug.bro)

  o Fixing typo in util.py. Closes #223.

  o Added note to README pointing to HTML version.

  o Disabling print_hook for proxies' remote.log.

  o broctl's capstats now reports a total as well, and stats.log
    tracks these totals. Closes #160.

  o Avoiding spurious "waiting for lock" messages in cron mode.
    Closes #206.

  o Bug fixes for installation on NFS.

  o Bug fix for top command on FreeBSD 8.

  o crash-diag now checks whether gdb is available.

  o trace-summary reports the sample factor in use in its output,
    and now also applies it to the top-local-networks output (not
    doing the latter was a bug).

  o Removed the default twice-a-day rotation for conn.log. The
    default rotation for conn.log now is now once every 24h, just
    like for all other logs with the exception of mail.log (which is
    still rotated twice a day, and thus the alarms are still mailed
    out twice a day).

  o Fixed the problem of logs sometimes being filed into the wrong
    directory (see the (now gone) FAQ entry in the README).

  o One can now customize the archive naming scheme. See the
    corresponding FAQ entry in the README.

  o Cleaned up, and extended, collection of cluster statistics.

    ${logdir}/stats now looks like this:

      drwxr-xr-x   4 bro  wheel      59392 Apr  5 17:55 .
      drwxr-xr-x  96 bro  wheel       2560 Apr  6 12:00 ..
      -rw-r--r--   1 bro  wheel        576 Apr  6 16:40 meta.dat
      drwxr-xr-x   2 bro  wheel       2048 Apr  6 16:40 profiling
      -rw-r--r--   1 bro  wheel  771834825 Apr  6 16:40 stats.log
      drwxr-xr-x   2 bro  wheel       2048 Apr  6 16:25 www

    stats.log accumulates cluster statistics collected every time
    "cron" is called.

    - profiling/ keeps the nodes' prof.logs.

    - www/ keeps a subset of stats.log in CSV format for easy plotting.

    - meta.dat contains meta information about the current cluster
    state (in particular which nodes we have, and when the last
    stats update was done).

    Note that there is not Web setup yet to actually plot the data
    in www/.

  o BroControl now automatically maintains links inside today's log
    archive directory pointing to the current live version of the
    corresponding log file (if Bro is running). For example:

    smtp.log.11:52:18-current -> /usr/local/cluster/spool/manager/smtp.log

  o Alarms mailed out by BroControl now (1) have the notice msg in the
    subject; and (2) come with the full mail.log entry in the body.
